UI tests
- Successful transfer from listing to room select
- ⁠Default value check
- ⁠Default value check for negative scenario (Invalid dates, formats, missing info)
- ⁠Validate available property from API
- ⁠Validate property description 
- ⁠Validate other data from API

No results page

- ⁠zero parameters

No search location error message when location parameter is missing
Partial booked scenario -> Both start and end date one by one in booked period
Demo condominium supports 16 PAX -> should not show up when searching for 17 PAX

*****************

Potential Bugs Found
Demo Hotel Louge allows us to select or add to cart rooms for 24 PAX when the max search limit is 20
Country should be auto populated as we already know the customer country because we’re proving the phone code automatically
Site logo should be clickable and should redirect to home page (in this case listing page)
Entering street view and then clicking on “click to see on map” doesn’t bring up the property on the map
